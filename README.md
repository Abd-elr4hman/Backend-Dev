# Backend-Dev
In this repo I follow the great Web-Dev [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-tutorial-and-projects-course/) by john smilga in Node.js and recreate the API's created through the course in python FastAPI.

## Contents:
1. Task-Manager-API.
2. Store-API.
3. Jobs-API.

## Goals:
* [x] Build highly scalable RESTful API's to create, read, update and delete data from a mongodb database.
* [x] Implement validation for endpoints to ensure that the data being entered is valid.
* [x] Implement pagination, sorting and filtering for get endpoints.
* [x] Use docker to build API containers.
* [x] Use kubernetes to deploy and manage containerized APIs.
* [ ] Use nginx as ingress controller to expose APIs to the internet.
* [ ] Implement horizontal pod autoscalling.
* [ ] Use prometheus and grafana to monitor the performance and health of APIs.
* [ ] Use kubernetes secrets to securely store the sensitive information.
